# Liquid Love - iOS App
I used CoreData and SwiftUI to build the "Liquid Love" iOS app. It is an iOS app that helps you to keep track of tasty wines that you enjoyed. 
You can rate them, add notes, enter a price and store them in your wine cellar. Of course, wines can be deleted using the typical swipe gesture in the list of wines or by using the remove button on any wine detail view. The emojis represent the wines' ratings in the wine list. I chose the emoji representation to avoid having loads and loads of rating stars in the list view. And to spice it up a bit. 
The list of wines is sorted using NSSortDescriptors and shows the best-rated wines first. I created the icon with Sketch.
