# Liquid Love - iOS App
I used CoreData and SwiftUI to build the "Liquid Love" iOS app. It is an iOS app that helps you to keep track of tasty wines that you enjoyed. 
You can rate them, write notes about the wine, enter its price and store them in your wine cellar.
The list of wines is sorted using NSSortDescriptors and shows the best-rated wines first. The icon was created using Sketch.
